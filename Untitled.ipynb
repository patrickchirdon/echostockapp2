A $30 discount off may not seem like much, but it effectively returns the iPad to its lowest price. As for the 256GB model, it’s currently $429, or $50 off its usual $479 price. Buy Apple iPad at Amazon - $299 Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham awarded Apple’s ninth-generation iPad a score of 86 in 2021. The 10.2-inch iPad is a solid entry-level tablet. With the company’s A13 Bionic chip inside, the 2021 model is fast, and you can expect to get about 10 to 14 hours from the battery. The new model also features a much-improved 12-megapixel front-facing camera with Apple’s Center Stage technology. The feature helps keep you in the middle of the frame during video calls.</td>\n",
